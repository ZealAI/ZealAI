Welcome to ZealAI!
A quiet place for loud thoughts.

Why it exists..
There're moments where faith gets..quiet
Zeal was built for these moments.      
Not to preach.
Not to argue theology.
Not to replace scripture, prayer or community.

Just a tool to help think clearly.

STATUS

It is evolving.
It is iperfect.
That is intentional.
